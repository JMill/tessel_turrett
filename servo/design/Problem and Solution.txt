[Design] Problem and Solution

PROBLEM I AM SOLVING
====================

High-level problem: Road intersections are dangerous, in part because cars, trucks, bicycles, and pedestrians are all in close proximity. If we have a camera and object identification system in place to watch the intersection, how can we output information to users of the road?

Low-level problem: To demonstrate an example of 'output information', can a controllable laser turret be built?

Solution Approach: The turret must operate on two axes (horizontal and vertical) and is to have a laser mounted on top to indicate its position.

The code is organized into the following directories:

    arduino/            -> script used for testing a servo's movements.
    blinky/             -> test routine for validating control of the Tessel board
    servo/
        dual_axis/      -> calibration and control scripts for the two-axis turret
        single_axis/    -> calibration and control scripts for a solo servo
